You\'d put your light network in individual and then switch your front light\'s mode to High Visibility, and do whatever you want with the other light\'s modes.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://d2mi8s9wlfjy1p.cloudfront.net/content/images/2018/09/P1020736.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://d2mi8s9wlfjy1p.cloudfront.net/content/images/2018/09/P1020737.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://d2mi8s9wlfjy1p.cloudfront.net/content/images/2018/09/P1020738.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Next we have the action that triggers the light to turn on.

We came for the radar, we stayed for the features, bravo Garmin.</p>','5b8aaa409e21af057f4723ab','The Garmin Varia RTL510 is equally as striking as it is technologically\nadvanced. On its maiden voyage I had more than a couple of my friends on our\ngroup ride ask me about it. I\'ve chosen to conclude that this is because of the\nsheer brightness of this light more than any other factor. The fact they were\nasking me about it was even more of a testament to its bling-appeal because I\nchoose to do The Beer Ride [https://ridewithgps.com/routes/25866161]  route, one\ndeemed \"too dangerous\" for group rides. A perfect proving ground for my 21 st\ncentury connected bike.\n\nPrice as Tested: $200\n\nWhats in the Box: \n * The Tail light unit itself\n * Quarter turn clampSmall diameter seat post rubber insertLarge diameter seat\n   post rubber insertSmall diameter O-ring strapLarge diameter O-ring strap\n * Charger and wall block\n\nBrightness: \nThis is a topic that must be stated first and cannot be understated.\n\nThis light is bright as hell.Garmin claims it\'s beam can be seen from up to a\nmile away, and while that\'s probably not true, it\'s not far off. Its beam is\nblinding when looking directly into it, yet manages to not annoy riders behind\nyou. In the context of a marketplace that charges $50 to $200 for a bright,\nquality tail light this slots in perfectly. Here\'s the catch, you guessed it,\nthis one has RADAR  Garmin could have left it at that, and included the light as\nan afterthought, but the utter brightness of this beacon suggests otherwise.\n\nThis is the light shown in a pitch black bathroom.The distance here is about 50\nfeet with no zoom. The subsequent images are zoomed form this same position.\nOperation:\nThe Varia radar system is a true game changer. Surely, we will argue for days\nand days as to if itactually  makes you any safer, but that is not the position\nI am depicting. Despite the outcome of these arguments (absolutely nothing) the\nVaria does  increase your awareness.  An easy comparison to make is that the\nVaria is like a motor vehicle\'s backup camera. Yes, we have mirrors and a neck\nthat can spin around and look, but why refuse the aid of a sophisticated\nmachine? (in the case of the backup cam you now can\'t according to the US\nfederal government) Awareness, like safety is a never ending uphill battle. It\nis not a binary, black and white, \"ok I\'m certainly safe\", issue that our brains\ntry to make it.\n\nWhen a car is approaching the sides of the screen will either go orange for a\nvehicle traveling at moderate speed, or red for a vehicle traveling at a high\nspeed. The definition of moderate or high speed appears to be relative to the\nspeed that you are traveling. I have not had the chance to do extensive testing\nto figure out where the threshold of high speed, but I feel that this should\nbecome evident as I spend more time with the Varia mounted up.\n\nThe position of the dots represents how far away the vehicle is from you.\nVehicles first show up on your screen (you are prompted with an audio cue as\nwell) at around 140 meters. During my initial test ride, when one would show up\nI would immediately spin around to observe how far the car was. I am not going\nto sit here and tell you I can distinguish how far a moving vehicle is behind\nme, on my bicycle, also moving, at a different speed. In all cases the car was\nmuch farther away than I had anticipated it would be to first pick up and\ndisplay on screen.\n\nAs you can see from the pictures above and below, the dots representing cars\nhave a tolerance that is higher than one might expect. The dot on the screen is\nnearly as close as it possibly can be while the red Honda Ridgeline is a good 20\nto 30 feet away. The radar\'s beam is 40 degrees to account for curves and\ncorners.\n\nThe side that the dots show up on is configurable, and actually comes with it in\nthe right position. I\'ve changed this to left to better simulate the position of\nthe cars on my display. Multiple cars will show up as multiple dots up to eight,\nand I really hope there is no need for more than that.\n\nConfiguration:\nBelow are all the configuration options available on the Garmin Edge 520. I\nspecify the model of my unit because I tend to RTFM (read the fucking manual),\nhave done some digging, and found that on the Edge 1000 (or possibly different\nVaria lights) there exists a motion activated option, that turns the light on\nand off based on weather or not your Edge device is moving.\n[https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/variabikelights/EN-US/GUID-4BCC3315-68A2-42E4-8D74-A37ABFB2BFB4.html] \n This option could be useful for, oh say, a mid ride beer or three. This option\nis not available on my particular setup, but  there are plenty of great options\nhere that I will highlight. (pun intended)\n\nHere we have the light mode in auto, which is what I leave it in. Garmin really\nwent the extra mile on this light by altering the light\'s intensity, not only by\nthe time of day, but also including an ambient light sensor to further get you\nto an optimal lumen level. The ambient light sensor really ties the package\ntogether with theTrail mode.  Any mountain biker who has tried to find sunglass\nlenses that work in a range of light levels from wide open, to lush foliage will\nsee where I\'m going with this. (and where I\'m going on the trail) I would not\nhave though I\'d be using a radar tail light on my mountain bike, but here we all\nare. We are fortunate in Roanoke, VA to have trails that we can ride to from\ndowntown, so this light complements the road sections, and then manages to\nconserve its battery, automatically on the singletrack.\n\nHigh visibility mode is exactly what it sounds like. Remember these are the\nglobal settings across the entire light network, so Individual just means that\neach light can have a different mode. Say you are using a Garmin front light and\ndon\'t want it to dim or shut off. You\'d put your light network in individual and\nthen switch your front light\'s mode to High Visibility, and do whatever you want\nwith the other light\'s modes.\n\nNext we have the action that triggers the light to turn on.

[/shop/dragons-back-tshirt]\nPortion of proceeds go to Blue Ridge Offroad Cyclists for North Mountain trail\nmaintenance.\n\nDragon’s Back, or North Mountain, looms over the mountain bike landscape\nliterally and figuratively, a monster of a thing. The daunting profile clearly\nexplains the nickname, becoming only more specific when riding across the 12\nmile spine--heavily landscaped with natural slate armor plates and limestone\nscales that clank and creak at times beneath the wheels. When the leaves are\ndown, a perpetual spectacular view to the east and west are presented along the\nsometimes inches wide path, as the thunder lizard stretches out with knobs and\npeaks and a gentle curve towards the north.\n\nBicycle exploration began in earnest in early 1990, first by national forest\nprinted map, then by personal contact. It was decided that since the ridge was\nonly 12 or so miles long, we’d do it end to end, float tripping as it were with\nautomobiles stashed at either end. In summary, a projected 3 hour tour became an\nall day ordeal, with cranks falling off, fire anthills swarming, and invisible\nridgeline trails. After a complete asswhupping taken, it was decided this place\nis definitely something special.\n\nPaul Economy and Scott Freday, The Lads of Virginia in those days, had fashioned\nin 1989 a backcountry race several ridges west on mighty Potts Mountain, called\nThe Great Craig County Escape. Mountain bike racing was rare enough in those\ndays, and that type of public land backcountry 26 mile epic remains so today.\nHaving already explored North Mountain a bit more, I suggested to the Lads that\na new race be added to the Craig County collection in 1992, and that it should\nbe called Dragon’s Back. It remained a suggestion and never materialized into\nbeing. The Great Escape even went missing that next year. A lot of work, this\nrace promotion business, and I needed help to make this reality. So Dragon’s\nBack stayed tucked away for a time.\n\nThat time was late in 1992 when East Coasters bike shop opened up beside a\nbuffet trough in Roanoke. The first manager, John Corliss, envisioned ambitious\nplans for the shop with a race being one of those. I presented the Dragon’s Back\nidea and the rest, as they say, is history. We took one giant step\nfurther--lashing it together with the well established Rowdy Dawg in Blacksburg\nalong with the new Thunderr In Holy Land in Thaxton. The Virginia State\nChampionship Mountain Bike Series was born, and the second ever mountain bike\nrace series east of the rockies (West Virginia’s WVMBA series began a year\nearlier) was born.\n\nApril 4, 1993, Dragon’s Back debuts to what would be 15 year run as the lead out\nrace of the series, inspiring more than one competitor to dub it, in NASCAR\nreference, the Daytona of Virginia. Mother Nature is to credit for that first\nposition because Rowdy Dawg was scheduled to lead out two Sundays earlier. But\nas things go, a freak March 13 blizzard piled on 18” of drifting snow that hung\naround for weeks, and was then slotted the week following Dragon’s Back I.\n\nFor two years the course climbed Deer Trail, rode the ridge to a Turkey descent,\nand then knitted together with the rolling gravel of Wildlife Road. Diamond Back\npro Gunnar Shogren from Morgantown, WV took the debut win, intimating at the\ntime that Dragon’s Back was clearly unlike any other. Mr. Shogren returned to\ndefend in ‘94 but was thwarted by the 19 year old Junior National Champion named\nFloyd Landis.\n\nIn subsequent years, all three ridge access trails were incorporated in a figure\neight pattern that would remain until the end: up Grouse, right to Deer descent,\nup Grouse, left to Turkey descent, and dirt road scramble back to the\nstart/finish--only 18 miles in length.\n\nOne memorable event in the late 90’s...some yayhoos fresh from shooting a\nturkey, then beer-bonging a case of PBR, discharged their 12 gauge towards a\nracer out for a Saturday pre-ride. Then they drove wildly and recklessly up and\ndown the road in a menacing manner. A payphone miles away was sought while we\nkept an eye out for quick cover, and the feds were summoned. This lead to a\nlengthy investigation, with several camping racers-now-witnesses questioned and\nultimately arrests. Two criminals were charged and convicted in federal court\nwith racially motivated assault with a deadly weapon that lead to lengthy prison\nterms. This lead to my first federal subpoena and thankfully the only one to\ndate.\n\nThe first Dragon’s Back XXC (or marathon in USAC land) arrived in 2000 just in\ntime to kick off the millenium. As the second ever XXC (Misty Mountain Hop the\nfirst), the 40 mile course used the entire North Mountain ridge trail, and was\nconceived around the notion: less a race, more a long day’s ride. Beginning in\nmorning, the XXC racers would mingle with the regular 18 mile XC racers,\nblending to finish all at around the same time. XXC was a hit immediately and\nnow comprises half the participants of entire events--XC plus XXC combined. We\nhave the land, we must ride it! It’s astonishing that our quaint notion of ride\nquickly morphed into race with finish times sub 4 hours!\n\nThe last of the original run of Dragon’s Backs was April 15, 2007, a dark,\ndeeply gray and damp cold spring day. This is memorable because, while the race\nwas well attended and successfully completed despite conditions, things would\ngrow very dark one day later just a few miles away in Blacksburg when 31 people,\nand their murderer, would perish on the campus of Virginia Tech. Our thoughts\nremain with those affected to this and every day, and we wish no other similar\ninstance would ever befall innocent people, yet they do.\n\nAside from being a premier racing venue, Dragon’s Back remains well ridden, and\nalways challenging to this day. The North Mountain Trail has even earned the\nblue color coding on the National Geographic map #788 notation as a mountain\nbike trail, the only such designation on that map or many others in the Virginia\nNatGeo collection.\n\nWould the namesake race ever make a return heralding a second age of the\nDragon’s Back? It’s a nice idea--who knows? Anything is possible...Brandon\nJohnson forgetting his shoes in perfect fashion. He and the ride organizer, Ryan\nSheets drove an hour out to Roanoke and back for some Five Ten magic.The\nlegendary Ken Lee graced us with his presence and wisdom. We dug up the picture\nbelow from the Massanutten archives. Cheers Ken!Do not  get it twisted. These are some strong riders, and it is perfectly fine\nto walk when your elevation profile looks like this:\n\nThis is not  the Grouse trail descent that had absolutely everybody crashing and\ncutting tires, but this is pretty much how the Grouse descent went.Nick Bellucia\nwhipping the steel on his Kona Honzo around like Uma Therman with Honzo Steel\nMore Konas!Remarkably, Brandon and Ryan managed to catch up to us before we even\ndescended off the ridge!Yukon Cornelius has far more stoke than you can possibly\nimagine.\n Your browser does not support the video tag.Ken Lee claims his Commencal Meta\nAM v4 weighs just 28lbs with his current setup.

I round a corner to find a descent that follows one of these hallways so far I cannot see the end. We must hit it. This led to the Big Bear DH, which is the only solid downhill we found out there.

It does not feel as slack as some enduro sleds out there, it does not wander on climbs, yet it goes over whatever you point it at. Do not think it is muted like some more descent oriented bikes. It feels lively and is asking you for input on your lines, but knows that you don\'t necessarily need to pick them. Cornering is a similar story, it will be good no matter what, but still has vast headroom from there. This bike can run up to a 200mm (you read that right) dropper post in size large and extra large, however the one on this bike was 125mm and I felt low without ever thinking about getting my body way down.

The trails at Big Bear Lake were a perfect test track for rear suspension layouts, highly technical and punchy without many smooth sustained climbs. The bike excelled at all the technical features the Ole\' Big Bear could throw at it. Large embedded rock descents, no problem. Steep embedded rock uphills, just go over that rock there, no need to go around. The rear of this bike felt very familiar to my Turner Sultan, which makes sense as they are both DW-Link bikes using bushings on the pivots. The Ripmo only uses bushings in its lower pivots and Ibis will replace these for life. Just like my Sultan, and Pivots, I never even thought about the climb switch.</p><figure class=\"kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://d2mi8s9wlfjy1p.cloudfront.net/content/images/2018/09/P1020182.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><blockquote><em><strong>The DW-Link is so efficient I actually sometimes turn my rear lockout off</strong></em></blockquote><p>The night prior to riding the Ripmo, me and Carlo decided to leave at 12AM and go on a spontaneously epic night ride. With plenty of malt-fueled courage we set out to the Pine Spur trail. This trail is in an artificial pine forest which contains hallways of trees all perfectly planted inline with each other. I round a corner to find a descent that follows one of these hallways so far I cannot see the end. We must hit it. This led to the Big Bear DH, which is the only solid downhill we found out there. A very fast trail with large loose rocks and plenty of huckortunities, this was like our home trails in Roanoke. While my Turner climbs well, and descends capably, it is a tall and steep bike. It gets battered around on chunk, yet always makes it.</p><figure class=\"kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://d2mi8s9wlfjy1p.cloudfront.net/content/images/2018/09/P1020232.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>9AM next morning, I\'m the first one at the Ibis tent, saddled up and ready to go.

It does not feel as slack as some enduro sleds out there, it does not wander on climbs, yet it goes over whatever you point it at. Do not think it is muted like some more descent oriented bikes.

The carbon equation goes like this: $1000 = 1lb lighter. Yes plasti-bikes ride sweet, but $1000 in my suspension rides a lot sweeter. The Ripmo is the perfect intro into carbon bikes. It takes everything that could make you skeptical and flips it over on its side.

This problem,\nhowever, is getting better with brands such as Rocky Mountain, and Pivot all\nhaving demo days here at some point in the past year, yet there are still some\nelusive brands containing bikes bursting at the seams with hype. Do I want to\ndrop multi thou on this plastic tubed ballooner bike? Do I want to just accept\nits 2018 and buy an internet bike? This is where Dirt Rag\'s Dirt Fest West\nVirginia comes in. Nestled on the airstrip at Big Bear Lake, West Virginia about\n30 miles from Morgantown. The list of brands at Dirt Fest is comprehensive,  to\nsay the least, but here goes: Pivot (title sponsor), Specialized, Trek,\nTransition, Surly, Norco, E-Motion, Yeti, Scott, and Ibis. I pressed on to Dirt\nFest for one bike, and one bike only, the Ibis Ripmo.\n\nMe and my father\'s Turner Sultans and Carlo Dy\'s Scott Genius. Someone remarked:\n\"I\'ve never seen so many Turners!\"Upon approaching the Ibis tent I quickly\nchatted with Harry, the rep, telling him that I had already ordered this bike,\nbut it would not be in until early August. \"We pretty much knew we knocked it\nout of the park with this one, and our sales exceeded expectations by 4 times.\"\nI will be impressed (and delighted) if Ibis is able to get me my frame by\nAugust. Upon arriving at the tent at 9 AM, when the expo opens, I see the last\nsize large Ripmo already  going out. This is a scenario that would occur 3 more\ntimes that day, preventing me from riding it until the next day. My companions,\nmy father Kyle Inman, and Carlo Dy are well suited in the size department for\ndemos as they are size extra large, and small, respectively. After sulking for\nabout 30 seconds at the fact that both of my colleagues would get to ride the\nbike I\'ve already committed to  before me, I turned around and walked towards\nthe Transition tent and scooped up a Sentinel. Initially, I was nervous about\nthis decision. The sentinel is a bike that I have been looking at for some time.\nIt is a direct competitor to the Ripmo, it comes in aluminum, (my preference)\nand everyone loves it. Would this make me regret my commitment? I didn\'t care, I\nneeded something equally as cool as my mates.\n\nWe pretty much knew we knocked it out of the park with this one, and our sales\nexceeded expectations by 4 timesAnyone brave enough to talk shop with me knows I\nam a Dave Weagle devotee. I spend much more time going up than I do going down,\nand the DW-Link is so efficient I actually sometimes turn my rear shock lockout \noff  when climbing.\n\nI approach bike demos as a learning experience. I ride things I don\'t prefer in\norder to expand my perspective and break out of my own echo chamber.

Cash\n\nWilson Creek runs clean and cool most of the time, gurgling over a 1930’s dam\npretending to be a lovely clear running trout stream flowing lazily southward\nout of Douthat State Park in the Alleghany Highlands of Virginia. I hate Wilson\nCreek.\n\nA number of distinct logistics nightmares rob race directors of sleep: injury\npotential, clear and complete course marking, course sabotage, Rescue Squad\nsupport, ops plan, adequate dependable volunteers, so forth. Weather, the bad\nkind, owns the highspot on on that list. By May, the myriad of nasty jet stream\ndelivered byproducts of winter have usually melted away (In this, the winter\nwith no end, never so sure).\n\nI hate Wilson Creek. The precise year evades me, but on the first Sunday in May\nof about 2000, wide awake I was introduced to the Babadook, whose form in this\nlegend is described as 9 inches of gushing rain, lashing a small patch of Bath\nCounty in just 2 hours time a bit after midnight. At 11 that night, I sat\noutside gazing at stars under a clear, jet black sky whilst pondering the Middle\nMountain Momma ops plan for the race in the morning.\n\nWater slakes quickly down the solid slopes of these ancient Alleghanys, finding\ncreases and crevasses that flow, in accordance with gravity’s law, downward into\nthe rivers and creeks. During supercells, even the finest of all natural\ndrainage systems get overwhelmed and pukes brown junked up water all over the\nplace,and on down into Wilson Creek, dragging dirt, trees, leaves, small\nrodents, and whatever it grabs along with it.\n\nUp that morning, the rain was gone. Hot damn! There’s a race on. To the staging\narea at once!\n\nThe green truck was already there. The dirt road where it sat leads to the\nstaging zone a quarter mile up and across the low water bridge below the dam. A\nfellow named Tad wearing a natty state park uniform tersely informs me without\nso much as a g’mornin that “there won’t be no race today. Water’s 5 feet over\nthe bridge.” Staging and racing takes place just the other side of the bridge.\nCan’t remember too much after that, stunned except all the folks setup in\nCampground C (renamed Carson) also on the other side of a sister bridge\ndownstream, were awarded an extra nights free camping. Among the stranded, pro\nand National Champ Sue Haywood.\n\nI hate Wilson Creek. The dam looked like a brown Niagara with uprooted trees and\nstumps spilling over rather than lunatics in barrels.\n\nRacers en route had no idea what with a decent forecast for the day. Sponsors\nand food prep folks en route had no idea. Despite previous experience with\nchallenging conditions, I’d never scratched a race before, so therefore lacked\nexperience doing so. What I did know was a foul, twisted gut sickness with\nrandom spastic thoughts firing through my thinking bit, seeking logic and flow,\nbut finding only fog and disorientation.\n\nThere are, of course, things much much worse. Life, the story goes, carries on.\nWe work on it, clean up the mess and move on. This, the rain of the century was\nnow behind us, so we’re good for a hundred years, right? No way this happens\nagain.\n\nExcept it did. Twice.\n\nThe worst part of do-overs isn’t refunds nor the doing again that which was\ndone. You simply lose all but maybe one third participation. This race isn’t\nrequired, like a pro or NICA race, with racer’s calendars all but\nset--understandable.\n\n2011, rain yes, but we launched the 9:30AM XXC racers before the big stuff\nstarted coming down. God bless those folks who endure through dark George\nWashington National Forest backcountry while Wilson Creek crept higher and\nhigher. Well shy of the noon XC start, the water lapped over and we were forced\nto evacuate staging, and get across Wilson Creek quickly. There would be no XC,\nand there was no way to notify the 40 mile racers on course. A re-route was\nquickly engineered, bypassing Stony Run. Miraculously, everyone made it out\nalive, damp, not defeated. We would return, and run a meager XC a few weeks\nanon.\n\n2017, rain yes, arriving a few days ahead of raceday despite 6 weeks of drought.\nMulti inches, submerged bridges, the green truck emerges: “won’t be a race\nSunday.” My already lean race operation is reeling, wobbly as my constitution on\nthe brink of submerging neath the thrashing brown water of Wilson Creek.\nRegroup, alas, redo, and keep moving.\n\nMay 4, me and #1 son in for Lasso Loop recon and markup. It’s hot, dry. The\nWilson Creek two time crossing is low, incredibly clear. We were about to be\ndouble crossed.\n\nThe green truck arrived on Saturday, May 5. “Big rain’s coming, 2 inches or\nmore. Cancellation is likely for tomorrow’s race.” No, just...no.\n\nNo rain most all that day, just a brief but sturdy downpour around 3 in the\nafternoon. Denial is a God given emotional protection circuit. Tack up the last\nof infinity arrows Momma requires. Head to to town for a Tavern Burger and IPA\nthen home to the Buckhorne Bungalow to wait and see and fend off dread. It rains\nmore than 2 inches that night.\n\nNo rain that morning, had we dodged the deluge? As one who counts only hatched\nchicks, feelings were short of optimistic though it was not raining! Driving in\nalongside my liquid nemesis I observed the water was high and milky. Uh oh. The\nCamp Carson roadway to staging approached...do I spy the green truck? No green\ntruck? No green truck! There’s a race on...the 20th year, 21st running of Middle\nMountain Momma. Not only was no green truck there to shut us down, there was no\ncontact with any park officials all day long. So quiet like we weren’t even\nthere.\n\nWe were the eye of the stormDespite the weather we had 40 XXC racers start, and\none get robbed of a start because of a cracked frame.

Epic ain\'t the word. The RockStar VA gets its absolutely perfect name from the town of Harrisonburg, also known as Rocktown, and the town of Roanoke, also known as The Star City. The race offers 3 grueling routes, trail (270 miles, 36k feet), gravel (260 miles, 20k feet), and pave (164 miles, 9.7k feet). Two facts stand out as astounding statements to the nature of the area in which this race takes place. This is a one way, 270 mile ride on trail that only gives you a taste of each trail section.

Alas, I understand\nthat after all, DT Swiss is a business and I bought it, because they sold it. At\nthe end of the day you can\'t beat modularity and upgradability of these hubs.\nThe fact that this ratchet is quieter than the already astoundingly quiet 18t\nhub is icing on the cake, and makes this truly a worthwhile upgrade.','https://d2mi8s9wlfjy1p.cloudfront.net/content/images/2018/09/dt-swiss-54t-ratchet.jpg',0,0,'published',NULL,'public',NULL,'Quick Engagement, Quicker Install.
