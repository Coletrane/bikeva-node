Roanoke Parks and Rec chief Michael Clark came\nthrough, however, and how cool is that? Site planning and all that stuff took\nplace and the track found an ideal home in the center of the hip southwest city\nWasena neighborhood. Most assembly took place on a single day in July with\nlandscaping the next.\n\nYet Mr. Glenn remains far from done. His vision calls for a multi-component\nbicycle skills improvement playground at Wasena, with the particulars of that\nbeing brainstormed at this moment. While manufactured equipment is readily\navailable (for a price of course), the pieces might just as well be built with\nnatural ingredients--like rocks--or custom built to spec. If you have experience\nor ideas on this, please scribble us a line with those suggestions.','\n',char(10)),'/content/images/2018/09/pump-track.jpg',0,0,'published',NULL,'public',NULL,'Roanoke got pumped on August 2, 2018 in a whole new way by means of a manufactured traveling pump track.','5b895f71ab851a2551af3d4b','2018-09-01 15:38:10','1','2018-09-01 16:55:08','1','2018-08-02 15:37:00','1',replace('Track Dedicated August 2, 2018\nRoanoke got pumped on August 2, 2018 in a whole new way by means of a manufactured traveling pump track.','\n',char(10)),'','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

[/shop/dragons-back-tshirt]\nPortion of proceeds go to Blue Ridge Offroad Cyclists for North Mountain trail\nmaintenance.\n\nDragon’s Back, or North Mountain, looms over the mountain bike landscape\nliterally and figuratively, a monster of a thing. The daunting profile clearly\nexplains the nickname, becoming only more specific when riding across the 12\nmile spine--heavily landscaped with natural slate armor plates and limestone\nscales that clank and creak at times beneath the wheels. When the leaves are\ndown, a perpetual spectacular view to the east and west are presented along the\nsometimes inches wide path, as the thunder lizard stretches out with knobs and\npeaks and a gentle curve towards the north.\n\nBicycle exploration began in earnest in early 1990, first by national forest\nprinted map, then by personal contact. It was decided that since the ridge was\nonly 12 or so miles long, we’d do it end to end, float tripping as it were with\nautomobiles stashed at either end. In summary, a projected 3 hour tour became an\nall day ordeal, with cranks falling off, fire anthills swarming, and invisible\nridgeline trails. After a complete asswhupping taken, it was decided this place\nis definitely something special.\n\nPaul Economy and Scott Freday, The Lads of Virginia in those days, had fashioned\nin 1989 a backcountry race several ridges west on mighty Potts Mountain, called\nThe Great Craig County Escape. Mountain bike racing was rare enough in those\ndays, and that type of public land backcountry 26 mile epic remains so today.\nHaving already explored North Mountain a bit more, I suggested to the Lads that\na new race be added to the Craig County collection in 1992, and that it should\nbe called Dragon’s Back. It remained a suggestion and never materialized into\nbeing. The Great Escape even went missing that next year. A lot of work, this\nrace promotion business, and I needed help to make this reality. So Dragon’s\nBack stayed tucked away for a time.\n\nThat time was late in 1992 when East Coasters bike shop opened up beside a\nbuffet trough in Roanoke. The first manager, John Corliss, envisioned ambitious\nplans for the shop with a race being one of those. I presented the Dragon’s Back\nidea and the rest, as they say, is history. We took one giant step\nfurther--lashing it together with the well established Rowdy Dawg in Blacksburg\nalong with the new Thunderr In Holy Land in Thaxton. The Virginia State\nChampionship Mountain Bike Series was born, and the second ever mountain bike\nrace series east of the rockies (West Virginia’s WVMBA series began a year\nearlier) was born.\n\nApril 4, 1993, Dragon’s Back debuts to what would be 15 year run as the lead out\nrace of the series, inspiring more than one competitor to dub it, in NASCAR\nreference, the Daytona of Virginia. Mother Nature is to credit for that first\nposition because Rowdy Dawg was scheduled to lead out two Sundays earlier. But\nas things go, a freak March 13 blizzard piled on 18” of drifting snow that hung\naround for weeks, and was then slotted the week following Dragon’s Back I.\n\nFor two years the course climbed Deer Trail, rode the ridge to a Turkey descent,\nand then knitted together with the rolling gravel of Wildlife Road. Diamond Back\npro Gunnar Shogren from Morgantown, WV took the debut win, intimating at the\ntime that Dragon’s Back was clearly unlike any other. Mr. Shogren returned to\ndefend in ‘94 but was thwarted by the 19 year old Junior National Champion named\nFloyd Landis.\n\nIn subsequent years, all three ridge access trails were incorporated in a figure\neight pattern that would remain until the end: up Grouse, right to Deer descent,\nup Grouse, left to Turkey descent, and dirt road scramble back to the\nstart/finish--only 18 miles in length.\n\nOne memorable event in the late 90’s...some yayhoos fresh from shooting a\nturkey, then beer-bonging a case of PBR, discharged their 12 gauge towards a\nracer out for a Saturday pre-ride. Then they drove wildly and recklessly up and\ndown the road in a menacing manner. A payphone miles away was sought while we\nkept an eye out for quick cover, and the feds were summoned. This lead to a\nlengthy investigation, with several camping racers-now-witnesses questioned and\nultimately arrests. Two criminals were charged and convicted in federal court\nwith racially motivated assault with a deadly weapon that lead to lengthy prison\nterms. This lead to my first federal subpoena and thankfully the only one to\ndate.\n\nThe first Dragon’s Back XXC (or marathon in USAC land) arrived in 2000 just in\ntime to kick off the millenium. As the second ever XXC (Misty Mountain Hop the\nfirst), the 40 mile course used the entire North Mountain ridge trail, and was\nconceived around the notion: less a race, more a long day’s ride. Beginning in\nmorning, the XXC racers would mingle with the regular 18 mile XC racers,\nblending to finish all at around the same time. XXC was a hit immediately and\nnow comprises half the participants of entire events--XC plus XXC combined. We\nhave the land, we must ride it! It’s astonishing that our quaint notion of ride\nquickly morphed into race with finish times sub 4 hours!\n\nThe last of the original run of Dragon’s Backs was April 15, 2007, a dark,\ndeeply gray and damp cold spring day. This is memorable because, while the race\nwas well attended and successfully completed despite conditions, things would\ngrow very dark one day later just a few miles away in Blacksburg when 31 people,\nand their murderer, would perish on the campus of Virginia Tech. Our thoughts\nremain with those affected to this and every day, and we wish no other similar\ninstance would ever befall innocent people, yet they do.\n\nAside from being a premier racing venue, Dragon’s Back remains well ridden, and\nalways challenging to this day. The North Mountain Trail has even earned the\nblue color coding on the National Geographic map #788 notation as a mountain\nbike trail, the only such designation on that map or many others in the Virginia\nNatGeo collection.\n\nWould the namesake race ever make a return heralding a second age of the\nDragon’s Back? It’s a nice idea--who knows? Anything is possible...Brandon\nJohnson forgetting his shoes in perfect fashion. He and the ride organizer, Ryan\nSheets drove an hour out to Roanoke and back for some Five Ten magic.The\nlegendary Ken Lee graced us with his presence and wisdom.

The bike excelled at all the technical features the Ole'' Big Bear could throw at it. Large embedded rock descents, no problem.

I round a corner to find a descent that follows one of these hallways so far I cannot see the end. We must hit it. This led to the Big Bear DH, which is the only solid downhill we found out there. A very fast trail with large loose rocks and plenty of huckortunities, this was like our home trails in Roanoke. While my Turner climbs well, and descends capably, it is a tall and steep bike.

It does not feel as slack as some enduro sleds out there, it does not wander on climbs, yet it goes over whatever you point it at. Do not think it is muted like some more descent oriented bikes. It feels lively and is asking you for input on your lines, but knows that you don''t necessarily need to pick them.

This problem,\nhowever, is getting better with brands such as Rocky Mountain, and Pivot all\nhaving demo days here at some point in the past year, yet there are still some\nelusive brands containing bikes bursting at the seams with hype. Do I want to\ndrop multi thou on this plastic tubed ballooner bike? Do I want to just accept\nits 2018 and buy an internet bike? This is where Dirt Rag''s Dirt Fest West\nVirginia comes in. Nestled on the airstrip at Big Bear Lake, West Virginia about\n30 miles from Morgantown. The list of brands at Dirt Fest is comprehensive,  to\nsay the least, but here goes: Pivot (title sponsor), Specialized, Trek,\nTransition, Surly, Norco, E-Motion, Yeti, Scott, and Ibis. I pressed on to Dirt\nFest for one bike, and one bike only, the Ibis Ripmo.\n\nMe and my father''s Turner Sultans and Carlo Dy''s Scott Genius. Someone remarked:\n"I''ve never seen so many Turners!"Upon approaching the Ibis tent I quickly\nchatted with Harry, the rep, telling him that I had already ordered this bike,\nbut it would not be in until early August. "We pretty much knew we knocked it\nout of the park with this one, and our sales exceeded expectations by 4 times."\nI will be impressed (and delighted) if Ibis is able to get me my frame by\nAugust. Upon arriving at the tent at 9 AM, when the expo opens, I see the last\nsize large Ripmo already  going out. This is a scenario that would occur 3 more\ntimes that day, preventing me from riding it until the next day. My companions,\nmy father Kyle Inman, and Carlo Dy are well suited in the size department for\ndemos as they are size extra large, and small, respectively. After sulking for\nabout 30 seconds at the fact that both of my colleagues would get to ride the\nbike I''ve already committed to  before me, I turned around and walked towards\nthe Transition tent and scooped up a Sentinel. Initially, I was nervous about\nthis decision. The sentinel is a bike that I have been looking at for some time.\nIt is a direct competitor to the Ripmo, it comes in aluminum, (my preference)\nand everyone loves it. Would this make me regret my commitment? I didn''t care, I\nneeded something equally as cool as my mates.\n\nWe pretty much knew we knocked it out of the park with this one, and our sales\nexceeded expectations by 4 timesAnyone brave enough to talk shop with me knows I\nam a Dave Weagle devotee.

Luckily, this was a perfect\nchance to really stretch the legs of my Canyon Endurace. As the name implies the\nbike is made for long distance and long days in the saddle. With tiny, flexy\nseatstays and 32c Bontrager AW2 tires, tubeless, with 60 psi in them, it rides\nlike a cloud.

Rob\nIssem has shown up, not on a 22lb XC crusher, but his carbon YT Jeffsey! This\nwas Rob''s last ride on the bike until he ships it off to Bend, Oregon for the\nHigh Cascades 100.

At 10 miles in,\none is adequately warmed up and ready for the climb, but that makes it no less\ngrueling. 10% grade for an entire mile up this mother. The payoff is more than\nworth it though.
